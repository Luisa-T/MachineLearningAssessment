    "Describe: Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer\n",

    "plots to describe the Boston House Prices [1] dataset. This part is worth 20% of\n",
    "your overall mark.\n",
    "Infer: To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential\n",
    "statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices\n",
    "between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should\n",
    "explain and discuss your findings within the notebook. This part is also worth\n",

    "Predict: Again using the same notebook, use keras [7] to create a neural network\n",

    "The minimum standard for this assessment is a git repository containing a README file\n",

    "should contain a summary of your work and provide instructions as to how to run the\n",
