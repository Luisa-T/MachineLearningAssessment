# Machine Learning and Statistics Assessment

by Luisa Timothy

There are three parts which will be addressed:

#### Describe: 
Create a git repository and make it available online for the lecturer to clone. The repository should contain all your work for this assessment. 
Within the repository, create a jupyter notebook that uses descriptive statistics and plots to describe the Boston House Prices dataset. This part is worth 20% of your overall mark. 

#### Infer: 
To the above jupyter notebook, add a section where you use inferential statistics to analyse whether there is a significant difference in median house prices between houses that are along the Charles river and those that aren’t. You should explain and discuss your findings within the notebook. This part is also worth 20%. 

#### Predict: 
Again using the same notebook, use keras to create a neural network that can predict the median house price based on the other variables in the dataset. You are free to interpret this as you wish — for example, you may use all the other variables, or select a subset. This part is worth 60%.
